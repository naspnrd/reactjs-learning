<!-- React - library or framework
Diff -> Google it -->
<!-- The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. 
When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call 
the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a 
few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. -->
<!-- You tell libraries what to do, frameworks tell you what to do. -->

    <!-- <h1>Hello World!!!</h1> -->
    <!-- what ever present inside the div of root will replaced by whatever we pass in render
         method
    -->
    <!-- <div id="root">
        <h1>hello Me</h1>
        <h1>hello Me</h1>
        <h1>hello Me</h1>
        <h1>hello Me</h1>
    </div> -->
    
    <!-- Common practice by developers is they pass Not rendered inside root
        for debugging purposes as if Not Rendered is coming on browser means
        they is more issue with react
    -->
    <div id="root">Not Rendered</div>

    <!-- Pure JS -->

    <!-- <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World!!!";
        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);
    </script> -->


    <!-- React is not limited to Browsers only, It also works on mobile devices, 
    also works on rendering like We have React Native, React 3d.
    that's why we have these two like one for react and one for react dom
    First Link: react@18 means react 18th version
    Second Link: react-dom@18, dom means web version of react -->
    <!-- by inseerting the CDN link, it make its react's shortest program -->
    <!-- By inserting react in index.html, we will get access to React in our developer's tool -->
    <!-- <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> -->

    <!-- Now we will not using react CDN links as we will instant react in our node modules-->
<!-- React without JSX -->

    <script type = "module" src="src/App.js" ></script>
